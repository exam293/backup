National curriculum in England

Purpose of study

A high-quality geography education should inspire in pupils a curiosity and fascination
about the world and its people that will remain with them for the rest of their lives.
Teaching should equip pupils with knowledge about diverse places, people, resources and
natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth’s key
physical and human processes. As pupils progress, their growing knowledge about the
world should help them to deepen their understanding of the interaction between physical
and human processes, and of the formation and use of landscapes and environments.
Geographical knowledge, understanding and skills provide the frameworks and
approaches that explain how the Earth’s features at different scales are shaped,
interconnected and change over time.

Aims
The national curriculum for geography aims to ensure that all pupils:
* develop contextual knowledge of the location of globally significant places – both
terrestrial and marine – including their defining physical and human characteristics and
how these provide a geographical context for understanding the actions of processes
* understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical
features of the world, how these are interdependent and how they bring about spatial
variation and change over time
* are competent in the geographical skills needed to:
* collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through
experiences of fieldwork that deepen their understanding of geographical
processes
* interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams,
globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
* communicate geographical information in a variety of ways, including through
maps, numerical and quantitative skills and writing at length.
